     * The way you configure your matcher items depend on your route structure.
     * E.g. if you decide to put all your posts under `/posts/[postSlug]`,
     * you'll need to add an extra matcher item "/posts/:path*".
     * The reason we do this is to prevent the middleware from matching absolute paths
     * like "demo.vercel.pub/_sites/steven" and have the content from `steven` be served.
     *
     * Here's a breakdown of each matcher item:
     * 1. "/"               - Matches the root path of the site.
     * 2. "/([^/.]*)"       - Matches all first-level paths (e.g. demo.vercel.pub/platforms-starter-kit)
     *                        but exclude `/public` files by excluding paths containing `.` (e.g. /logo.png)
     * 3. "/site/:path*"    – for app.vercel.pub/site/[siteId]
     * 4. "/post/:path*"    – for app.vercel.pub/post/[postId]
     * 5. "/_sites/:path*"  – for all custom hostnames under the `/_sites/[site]*` dynamic route (demo.vercel.pub, platformize.co)
     *                        we do this to make sure "demo.vercel.pub/_sites/steven" is not matched and throws a 404.
